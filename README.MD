The SocketLabs Email Delivery Ruby library allows you to easily send email messages via the [SocketLabs Injection API](https://www.socketlabs.com/api-reference/injection-api/).  The library makes it easy to build and send any type of message supported by the API, from a simple message to a single recipient all the way to a complex bulk message sent to a group of recipients with unique merge data per recipient.

# Prerequisites and Installation
## Prerequisites
* A supported Ruby version (2.4 and above)
* A SocketLabs account. If you don't have one yet, you can [sign up for a free account](https://signup.socketlabs.com/step-1?plan=free) to get started.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```
gem 'socketlabs-injectionapi'
```
Or install it yourself
```
gem install sendgrid-ruby
```

For more information please see the [Installing Gems](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/) tutorial

# Getting Started
## Obtaining your API Key and SocketLabs ServerId number
In order to get started, you'll need to enable the Injection API feature in the [SocketLabs Control Panel](https://cp.socketlabs.com). 
Once logged in, navigate to your SocketLabs server's dashboard (if you only have one server on your account you'll be taken here immediately after logging in). 
Make note of your 4 or 5 digit ServerId number, as you'll need this along with 
your API key in order to use the Injection API. 

To enable the Injection API, click on the "For Developers" dropdown on the top-level navigation, then choose the "Configure HTTP Injection API" option. 
Once here, you can enable the feature by choosing the "Enabled" option in the
dropdown. Enabling the feature will also generate your API key, which you'll 
need (along with your ServerId) to start using the API. Be sure to click the 
"Update" button to save your changes once you are finished.


## Basic Message
A basic message is an email message like you'd send from a personal email client such as Outlook. 
A basic message can have many recipients, including multiple To addresses, CC addresses, and even BCC addresses. 
You can also send a file attachment in a basic message.

```ruby
require "socketlabs-injectionapi.rb"

include SocketLabs::InjectionApi
include SocketLabs::InjectionApi::Message

message = BasicMessage.new

message.subject = "Sending A Basic Message"
message.html_body = "<html>This is the Html Body of my message.</html>"
message.plain_text_body = "This is the Plain Text Body of my message."

message.from_email_address = EmailAddress.new("from@example.com")

# A basic message supports up to 50 recipients 
# and supports several different ways to add recipients

# Add a To address by passing the email address
message.to_email_address.push("recipient1@example.com")
message.to_email_address.push(EmailAddress.new("recipient2@example.com", "Recipient #2"))

# // Adding CC Recipients
message.add_cc_email_address("recipient3@example.com")
message.add_cc_email_address("recipient4@example.com", "Recipient #4")

# Adding Bcc Recipients
message.add_bcc_email_address(EmailAddress.new("recipient5@example.com"))
message.add_bcc_email_address(EmailAddress.new("recipient6@example.com", "Recipient #6"))

# Your SocketLabs ServerId and Injection API key
client = SocketLabsClient.new(10000, "YOUR-API-KEY")

response = client.send(message)
```

## Bulk Message
A bulk message usually contains a single recipient per message 
and is generally used to send the same content to many recipients, 
optionally customizing the message via the use of MergeData. 
For more information about using Merge data, please see the [Injection API documentation](https://www.socketlabs.com/api-reference/injection-api/#merging).
```ruby
require "socketlabs-injectionapi.rb"

include SocketLabs::InjectionApi
include SocketLabs::InjectionApi::Message

# Your SocketLabs ServerId and Injection API key
client = SocketLabsClient.new(10000, "YOUR-API-KEY")

message = BulkMessage.new

message.subject = "Sending A Bulk Message"
message.plain_text_body = "This is the body of my message sent to %%Name%%"
message.html_body = "<html>This is the HtmlBody of my message sent to %%Name%%</html>"

message.from_email_address = EmailAddress.new("from@example.com")

    message.add_global_merge_data("HairColor", "{ not set }")

recipient1 = BulkRecipient.new("recipient1@example.com")
recipient1.add_merge_data("Name", "Recipient1")
message.add_to_recipient(recipient1)

recipient2 = BulkRecipient.new("recipient2@example.com", { :friendly_name => "Recipient #2" })
recipient2.add_merge_data("Name", "Recipient2")
message.add_to_recipient(recipient2)

response = client.send(message)
```

## Managing API Keys
For ease of demonstration, many of our examples include the ServerId (SOCKETLABS_SERVER_ID) and API key 
(SOCKETLABS_INJECTION_API_KEY) directly in our code sample. Generally it is not considered a good practice to store 
sensitive information like this directly in your code. Depending on your project type, we recommend either storing your 
credentials using Environment Variables. For more information please see: 
[Using Environment Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.getenvironmentvariable)

# Examples and Use Cases
In order to demonstrate the many possible use cases for the SDK, we've provided 
an assortment of code examples. These examples demonstrate many different 
features available to the Injection API and SDK, including using templates 
created in the [SocketLabs Email Designer](https://www.socketlabs.com/blog/introducing-new-email-designer/), custom email headers, sending 
attachments, sending content that is stored in an HTML file, advanced bulk 
merging, and even pulling recipients from a datasource.
